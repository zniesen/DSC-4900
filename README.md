## About the project
This project was originally for my data science independent studies and the course, DSC-4900, at Belmont University. I intend to continue applying what I have learned as I progress in my career and continue work on this. Currently, my progress is:
 - 1. Built a web scraping protocol to collect information from Yelp reviews, questions and answers, and more
 - 2. Review Analysis using NLP and data from the Yelp API to rate businesses on customer perception of accessibility as indicated by reviews.
 - 3. Built a recommendation system and simple UI that suggests businesses based on indicated accessibility needs
 - 4. Wrote an IRB proposal to continue research using feedback from disabled populations

##Languages Used
- Python
- SQL
- Javascript
- CSS

## Database Creation
The database manages data storage and organization for the Yelp Web scraping process using SQLite. Below is an outline of its structure and functionality.

#### Business Table: 
- Stores basic information about businesses listed on Yelp.
- Fields: business_id, business_name, address, phone, rating, num_revs (number of reviews), website, url, last_scraped.

#### Business Amenities Table: 
- Tracks amenities offered by businesses to enhance accessibility.
- Fields: business_id, amenities (comma-separated string).
- Function: insert_business_amenities() combines amenities into a single string and links them to the respective business.

#### Reviews Table
Holds user-generated reviews for businesses.
- Fields: review_id, business_id, review_content.
- Function: insert_review() associates reviews with their corresponding business and prevents inserting orphaned reviews.

## Scraping data from Yelp
The Yelp Web scraping process is recursive. ALlowing users to only input one URL, and then it flows from there. Unfortunately due to Yelp cracking down on web scraping. The cureent code is not functional on it's own. 

## Data Analysis, Recommendations, User Interface
### Dataset Information
Dataset Information
The dataset comprises a mix of:
- Previously scraped data (before Yelp's security escalation)
- Manually scraped data
- Yelp API responses
- Public Kaggle datasets

### Merged Data Dictionary
The datasets are merged using LINK TO CODE HERE, which produces "merged.csv", a csv with the following columns:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `business_id` | A unique identifier for each business, either provided in the dataset, or produced using the business name or part of the review site url|
| `title` | The name of the location |
| `review_id` | An identifier for each review either provided in the dataset, or produced by counting upwards and reseting for each business|
| `date` | a value representing the date scraped or the date the review was posted, depending on the dataset. It is included to offer an approximation of how up-to-date the information provided in the review is|
| `review_text` | the review content|
| `category` | type of location |
| `from` | the dataset the review came from |

### Data Analysis
This section covers the methodology for analyzing business reviews to assess accessibility features and sentiment trends using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
#### Accessibility Analysis Overview
The system processes review text to identify keywords related to accessibility features such as mobility accommodations, visual impairments, auditory sensitivity, and more. Sentiment analysis is applied to quantify positive, neutral, and negative experiences for each business.

##### Processing Steps
- **Extract Accessibility Keywords**: Using precompiled regex patterns, the script identifies relevant accessibility terms from business reviews.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses NLTKâ€™s Vader Sentiment Analyzer to score reviews.
- **Accessibility Scoring**: Each review's sentiment score is multiplied by the presence and frequency of accessibility keywords in each category, creating a weighted rating for multiple accessibility features.
- **Aggregated Business-Level Insights**: Reviews are grouped by business, accessibility scores from each review are aggregated to create an overview of the business location's accessibilty.
- **Adjust for Review Count**: The system adjusts for review count, producing normalized scores for accurate comparison.

##### Final Accessibility Score Computation 
For each business, the final output includes:
- Overall accessibility score (sum of individual feature scores)
- Sentiment-adjusted accessibility impact
- Breakdown of accessibility feature scores per business
- Weighted recommendation ranking

## Streamlit App
This Streamlit application provides a customized accessibility search tool, allowing users to filter businesses based on their specific needs. It includes multiple accessibility-enhancing features, such as text size adjustments and text-to-speech, ensuring an inclusive experience.

### Personalized Business Recommendations
The app uses business accessibility scores to rank and suggest locations based on selected accessibility needs.
- Users select relevant accessibility categories (mobility, cognitive accessibility, sensory sensitivities, etc.)
- A weighting system allows users to prioritize certain accessibility factors.
- Businesses are sorted dynamically based on the weighted score, ensuring personalized recommendations.
- If no accessibility needs are provided, then they are sorted based on overall accessibility scores
