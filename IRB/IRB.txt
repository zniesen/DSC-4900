DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH PLAN 
     Please be sure to address all of the following questions using lay language.  Please write in complete sentences. 

Clearly state the purpose(s) of your project.

The purpose of the project is to receive feedback from disabled people about what they want from a review website designed for them, what needs are unmet by current review sites and locations, 

Describe your study design. 

This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study utilizing an online survey format to gather feedback from disabled individuals regarding accessibility needs and user experience preferences on review websites.

Explain your instrumentation and methods. Please describe your proposed methodology step by step and attach a copy of surveys, educational tests, or interview scripts.  
	
	Participants will see receive a Qualtrics link or see a QR code and upon going to the link, they will see the consent form (Appendix A). If they click “No,” the survey will end, and, if they click “Yes,” they will be sent to the Disability Questionnaire (Appendix B). From there, they will be asked some questions about website accessibility (Appendix C). After completing that to their satisfaction, they will see some questions about what needs are currently unmet by review websites and they will be asked what specific areas of accessibility they would like to answer questions about (Appendix D). Their answers to that question will determine which portions of the survey they see next. 
	Appendices F-R are questionnaires that will only be shown to people who responded with that specific accessibility need: Anxiety (Appendix F); Auditory Impairments (Appendix H); Bathroom (Appendix I); Chronic pain/fatigue (Appendix J); Cognitive Impairment (Appendix K); Health/safety (Appendix L); Mobility (Appendix M); Parking (Appendix N), Predictability, Consistency, and Adjustability (Appendix O); Reading (Appendix P); Speech (Appendix Q); Sensory Sensitivities (Appendix R); and Visual impairments (Appendix S). The survey uses branching logic to adjust follow-up questions based on each participant’s indicated accessibility interests.
	Following their completion of their selected sections, they will see the Content Priorities Questionnaire (Appendix S). Following that, they will be sent to a Demographics Questionnaire survey (Appendix T). This will have their same ID, but, will not be included with the rest of their data.  Afterward, they will see a closing message (Appendix _) and have the option to take a separate Qualtrics survey (Appendix _) that just asks where they heard about this study. This information will not be connected in any way to their other information (different ID), and is simply to see which methods of advertising the study are effective at recruiting.

Describe your plan for data analysis and statistics (if applicable).
Descriptive research, so data analysis will largely depend on how many people fill out the survey, and which/how many questions each of them answers. 

SUBJECTS
1.	Number of Subjects and Controls:
a. Number of subjects you intend to solicit: 1000 (Please note the number you intend to solicit should be more than the number you expect to participate.) 
	b. Approximate number of subjects you expect to participate: ~200
	c. Proposed number of controls (if appropriate): N/A

2.	 Types of Subjects and Controls:
	a.    Age range of subjects: 18+
	b.    Population from which subjects were derived: disabled individuals with internet access
	c.    Inclusion criteria for subjects and controls: identify as disabled in some way
d.    Exclusion criteria for subjects and controls (Include any age, sex, physical, mental and health restrictions): 

3.	Describe the specific steps to be used to identify and/or contact prospective participants. If applicable, describe how you have access to lists of potential participants. Recruitment telephone and/or e-mail scripts and advertisements should be submitted with this form as well.

Links will be provided to different spaces including a Disabled in STEM mentorship program Slack Channel, Discord Servers, iMessage group chats, word of mouth, social media, and posters (will be included in an IRB modification)

4.	Subject Screening Procedures: Describe the screening procedures you will use to determine if subjects are able to participate in your study.  Specifically explain how the results of your screening procedures will be used to identify subjects who are eligible to participate in your study and identify persons who are ineligible to participate in your study. Attach any questionnaires or screening forms you will use with this application.
Theoretically, anyone should be able to participate in this. It will be requested that only disabled people respond to it, but there won’t be anything stopping someone else from taking it because we will not be asking for them to give any information that might jeopardize their anonymity.

5.	Describe the tasks that participants will be asked to perform for each phase of the study.
The tasks are all questionnaires. The number of questions and which questions are asked will be determined by their responses to prior questions.

              If yes, please explain:

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS AND BENEFITS:   
1.	Exemption status may be granted only when minimal risk exists. Explain why participation in this study will involve minimal risk.

It will involve minimal risk because there is no manipulation. It is simply a survey about people’s opinions on accessibility, and participants are encouraged not to share information that may make them identifiable on every survey page. 

There is not greater discomfort than faced in everyday life because questions are simply asking about daily life. 

Note- Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
 
2.	What are the benefits of this study?

I am working on a greater project that scrapes review information from various websites and uses that information as a starting dataset for an accessibility-centered review website. The responses people give to this survey will inform decisions made in this venture, so that their needs are better met. Participating in this allows people to get their voices heard and allows me to serve this population better. Additionally, participants may become more educated on different aspects and kinds of accessibility that they had not considered or thought of prior, and, were there to be a publication using this data, they would be directly represented. 

PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA MANAGEMENT
Subject Privacy: What measures will you take to protect your subjects’ privacy? Examples include interviewing subjects one at a time in a closed room, interviewing subjects over the phone, or e-mailing a questionnaire in such a way that subjects cannot see identifying information of other subjects.

Subjects will never be able to see one another’s information because participation is 100% remote. Participants will have the option of filling out the survey on Qualtrics or printing and mailing a physical copy of the survey. 

Subject Confidentiality and Anonymity:  Indicate if your data will be anonymous.  If not anonymous, describe how data/study records will be kept confidential and specify safeguards to be implemented for protecting participant information and minimizing potential risks to subjects (i.e., password-protected computer(s), file encryption, etc.). If possible, consider how the data you collect could be anonymous (i.e., no identifiers).

Data will be totally anonymous. Absolutely no IP addresses, or anything of that nature will be collected. All questions are optional, so no one must answer anything they are uncomfortable with or that could identify them in order to participate.

Demographics questions and answers will be asked in a different survey with linked IDs to the first. Participants will also have the option to fill out the demographics form on a separate survey resource, with the idea being, in the event of a data breach, neither source would have enough information about the participants to identify them. 

The question about how they learned about this project will be in a completely separate survey from the main and demographics surveys (no ID linking, new form)

Data Confidentiality and Management:

Will you be audio or video recording subjects?   
                         Yes________  	No___X____
If yes, please explain why this is necessary. Also, please complete and include the Recording Permission form found on the IRB website. 

Please explain how you will protect the identities of subjects who have had audio or video recordings. The usual procedure is to transcribe recordings and then destroy the original audio or video recordings.  

Data Storage:
a.	How long do you plan to store your data? You must store data a minimum of three years per federal regulations.

Data will be stored for 3 years after data collection has ended.

b.	How will you dispose of your data at the end of your data storage time?

Any data will be overwritten multiple times before being deleted.

c.	Where will you store your data (be specific)? If you are de-identifying your data, where will you store your identification key? The identification key must be stored separately from   your data.

Data will be anonymously collected, and stored online in the survey platforms until data collection has ended, then it will be stored on a csv file on a personal, password protected device, and online survey data will be deleted. 



d.	Please explain who will have access to the data and under what circumstances.
No one save for Zoe Niesen, Kayla Ahrndt, and Christina Davis will have access to this data.

e.	How will you protect the data from unauthorized access?
It will be stored locally on a csv file on a personal, password protected device as soon as collection has ended, and Qualtrics data will be deleted. 


INFORMED CONSENT
1.	Describe your consent procedures. 
It must be clear in this description of informed consent that the PI(s) will provide the prospective subject sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider whether or not to participate and minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. 
The use of a signed consent document may not be required but those participants must be informed about the purpose of the study. If there is no in-person contact, an investigator will provide a participant an IRB-approved information sheet that does not require a signature explaining the purpose of the study, how the data will used, how the data will be kept anonymous, etc. (see “Forms”= “Consent for Exempt Projects” on the Belmont IRB webpage for guidelines for this letter).
People must agree to the conditions outlined in the consent form on Qualtrics in order to gain access to the survey. 

2.	Does this research involve the use of protected health information (PHI)? Yes

Note: If you plan to use or share protected health information (PHI) when conducting your research, you must conduct your study in accordance with the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This means that when applying for a waiver of documentation of consent, you will also have to request a waiver or alteration of HIPAA Authorization.  The IRB can grant the waiver of alteration if it deems the following criteria are met. Please address each part of the criteria:
a.	An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity absent a health or research justification or legal requirement to retain them, and
b.	An adequate plan to protect health information identifiers from improper use or disclosure
c.	An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity absent a health or research justification or legal requirement to retain them, and
d.	Adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be used or disclosed to a third party except as required by law, for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research uses and disclosures permitted by the Privacy Rule;
e.	Research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration; and
f.	Research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of PHI.

Any demographic information that is tied to participant data will be destroyed after data is cleaned. Demographic information will then be kept in a summarized format such that there will be no way to link together information that would make a subject identifiable.

Questions regarding health information are vague, and only specific enough to get the information needed. For example, questions would be asked, “Do you use mobility aides? What kind? How often?” rather than asking for the medical reason why behind someone’s mobility aide usage. 

All questions are optional. Subjects will be made aware of this and be encouraged not to answer questions that may deanonymize their response.

Important Information About the Research Study 
 Here are some things you should know about this study: 
•	You are invited to take part in a research study about the accessibility needs of people with disabilities when using review websites (e.g., for restaurants, businesses, or public spaces). The goal is to better understand how current websites serve—or fail to serve—these needs.
•	If you choose to participate, you will be asked to [do what, when, where, and how].  
•	Your participation will take approximately 15-35 minutes depending on how many questions you choose to answer
•	Risks or discomforts from this research include [briefly describe]. 
•	The study will [description of potential direct benefits to subjects – or no benefits]. 
•	Taking part in this research project is voluntary. You don’t have to participate, and you can stop at any time. 
More details are provided below about this research study. Please take all the time you need to read this entire form, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions. 
What is the study about and why are we doing it? 
This study explores how people with disabilities and related access needs engage with review websites and what kinds of information are most helpful in making decisions about public spaces and services. The goal is to identify ways to improve accessibility features and review systems to better meet community needs.
Belmont University expects to enroll approximately 200 participants in the research. 
What will happen if you take part in this study? 
If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a survey that includes 
-	A few general questions about disability or neurodivergent identity
-	Questions about your experience with website accessibility
-	Questions about accessibility needs not currently being met on review platforms
-	A set of sections based on accessibility areas that matter most to you (e.g., vision, anxiety, mobility, chronic pain, etc.)
-	A short set of questions about what content and features are most important to you
-	Some demographic questions 
All sections and questions of this survey is completely optional. We would prefer you to only answer questions that would be beneficial to you and do not pose a risk of making your response identifiable as yours.
How could you benefit from this study? 
You might benefit from being in this study because [insert description of why here] you would get your voice heard on the design and information used as part of an accessibility website 
What are the risks of being in this study? 
There are some risks you might experience from being in this study. They are that, in the event of a data breach, your responses could be used to identify you. To limit this risk, names and specific location information (IP addresses), will not be collected. 
Demographic information will also be requested on a different survey website, so that, in the event of a data breach on either platform, it would be harder to identify you.
You are also discouraged from answering any questions that could make your response identifiable as yours, and every question is optional. 
You must immediately tell the researchers if you have any injuries or other problems related to your participation in the study. The University may be able to assist you with obtaining emergency treatment, if appropriate, but you or your insurance company will be responsible for the cost. By signing this form, you do not give up your right to seek payment if you are harmed as a result of being in this study. 
Primary risks include information leakage. 
How will we protect your information? 
If we publish or present the results of this study at a conference, to protect your privacy, we will not include any information that could directly identify you.  
We will protect the confidentiality of your research records by not collecting any directly identifiable information and by storing any demographic information (race, gender, age group) separately from the rest of the survey data following download. Your name and IP address will not be collected, and all questions are optional. You will be encouraged not to answer any questions that make you uncomfortable, or that could make your response identifiable. 
It is possible that other people may need to see the information we collect about you. These people work for Belmont University, and are responsible for making sure the research is done safely and properly.  
Otherwise, data will only be stored on Qualtrics or on a password-protected device. 
What will happen to the information we collect about you after the study is over? 
We are required to keep your research data for a minimum of three years. Demographic information that can directly identify you will be deleted from the research data collected as part of the project, after data is cleaned and it is summarized. After three years, all of your research data will be destroyed. 
Demographic information might be removed from your private information collected as part of this research. The information could be used for future research or distributed to another Principal Investigator (PI) for future research without obtaining additional informed consent. 
Will you be paid for being part of this study? 
You will not receive anything for being in this study.   
What are the costs to you to be part of the study? 
 You do not need to pay anything to participate in this study, unless you prefer to mail in your survey responses.
Is your participation in this study voluntary? 
Your participation in this research study is entirely voluntary.
It is totally up to you to decide to be in this research study. Even if you decide to be part of the study now, you may change your mind and stop at any time.
